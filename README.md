## Related documentation

This service works alongside the [grants-ui frontend](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui). That README captures the end-to-end user journey and shared engineering practices. Useful companion sections include:

- [DXT Forms Engine Plugin](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#dxt-forms-engine-plugin) – how journeys are composed and which payloads this backend receives
- [Session Rehydration](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#session-rehydration) – lifecycle of state stored in MongoDB by this service
- [Structured Logging System](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#structured-logging-system) – log code conventions shared across UI and backend services
- [Analytics](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#analytics) – how application telemetry is captured on the frontend, complementing the events emitted here

Use this README for backend-specific setup; refer to the frontend README when you need context about journeys, shared tooling, or logging standards.

## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9` (the project is routinely tested with npm v10). You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd grants-ui-backend
nvm use
```

## Local development

### Docker Compose (recommended)

For a self-contained local environment (service plus MongoDB), use the provided Compose file:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This builds the development image and starts the dependencies defined in `compose.yml`. The backend is available on <http://localhost:3001> by default. Stop the stack with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To spin up the full stack with the frontend, follow the [Docker guidance in grants-ui](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#docker).

### Local Node environment

If you prefer to run the application directly on your machine, follow the steps below.

#### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Environment configuration

Copy the sample environment file and update the required variables:

```bash
cp .env.local .env
```

Set values for:

- `MONGO_URI` – address of your MongoDB instance (the default assumes a local database on port 27017)
- `GRANTS_UI_BACKEND_AUTH_TOKEN` – 64 character lowercase hexadecimal string (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `GRANTS_UI_BACKEND_ENCRYPTION_KEY` – 64 character lowercase hexadecimal string (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`)

An extended reference is available in `env.example.sh`.

Keep these values in sync with the frontend configuration described in the [grants-ui environment guidance](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#environment-variables) so clients can authenticate successfully.

#### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Testing

To test the application run:

```bash
npm run test
```

Integration tests rely on Docker (via Testcontainers) and can be run with:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

The frontend documents complementary UI testing patterns in its [testing framework section](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#testing-framework).

#### Git hooks

Husky installs a pre-commit hook during `npm install`. The hook runs `npm run format:check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test`, mirroring the workflow in [grants-ui](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui). If commits are blocked:

- run `npm run setup:husky` to reinstall the hooks
- address formatting or lint failures with `npm run lint:fix`
- fix failing tests locally before committing

#### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

#### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

#### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
npx npm-check-updates --interactive --format group
```

#### Formatting

##### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## OpenAPI Specification

An OpenAPI 3.1 specification is available at the repository root:

- File: [openapi.yaml](./openapi.yaml)

How to view it:

- Use any OpenAPI viewer or IDE plugin/extension (e.g. Swagger Viewer for VS Code or natively in IntelliJ).

Keeping the spec up-to-date:

- When you add or change routes (see src/plugins/router.js and src/routes/\*), update openapi.yaml accordingly.

## Development helpers

### Structured logging

Application logs follow the shared, code-driven format used by the Grants UI frontend. Log codes live in `src/common/helpers/logging/log-codes.js` and are validated on startup; unit tests exist alongside the helpers (`src/common/helpers/logging/*.test.js`). When introducing new log codes, mirror the approach described in the [frontend structured logging guide](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#structured-logging-system) and update the relevant tests.

### Application state and frontend rehydration

Mongo documents written to the `grant-application-state` collection are rehydrated by the frontend during user journeys. Review the [frontend session rehydration documentation](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#session-rehydration) before modifying stored shapes or lifecycle expectations, and update the OpenAPI schema plus Postman collection accordingly.

### MongoDB Locks

If you require a write lock for Mongo you can acquire it via `server.locker` or `request.locker`:

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  const lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  try {
    // do stuff
  } finally {
    await lock.free()
  }
}
```

Keep it small and atomic.

You may use **using** for the lock resource management.
Note test coverage reports do not like that syntax.

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  await using lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  // do stuff

  // lock automatically released
}
```

Helper methods are also available in `src/common/helpers/mongo-lock.js`.

### Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then
because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the
proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

The frontend relies on the same proxy configuration; see its [proxy documentation](https://github.com/DEFRA/grants-ui#proxy) if you are troubleshooting cross-repo HTTP behaviour.

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag grants-ui-backend:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run \
  -e PORT=3001 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  grants-ui-backend:development
```

Set any additional environment variables required by your deployment (see [Environment configuration](#environment-configuration)).

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag grants-ui-backend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run \
  -e PORT=3001 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  grants-ui-backend
```

Set any additional environment variables required by your deployment (see [Environment configuration](#environment-configuration)).

### Docker Compose

For day-to-day development, follow [Docker Compose (recommended)](#docker-compose-recommended). For reference, the same command is shown below:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)

## Postman Collection

The project includes a Postman collection to make it easier to test and interact with the API. This collection contains pre-configured requests for various endpoints and an environment file to manage variables like API URLs.

### Getting Started

1. **Install Postman**
   If you don’t already have Postman installed, download it from [Postman’s official site](https://www.postman.com/).

2. **Import the Collection**

   - Open Postman.
   - Go to **File > Import**.
   - Select the file `postman/grants-ui-backend.postman_collection.json`.

3. **Import the Environment (Optional)**
   If the project includes an environment file:

   - Go to **File > Import**.
   - Select the file `postman/grants-ui-backend.dev.postman_environment.json`.
   - Update variables like `base_url`, `api_key` or `grant_type` as needed.

4. **Set the Active Environment**
   - In Postman, click on the environment dropdown in the top right corner.
   - Select the imported environment (e.g., `dev`).

### Service-to-Service Authentication

The API uses AES-256-GCM encrypted tokens with Bearer Authentication.

#### Generating the Authorization Header

1. Setup your plain, secret value (GRANTS_UI_BACKEND_AUTH_TOKEN) and encrypt/decrypt key (GRANTS_UI_BACKEND_ENCRYPTION_KEY) in your `.env` (see also `.env.local`):

```
GRANTS_UI_BACKEND_AUTH_TOKEN=<your token>
GRANTS_UI_BACKEND_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your encryption key>
```

2. Use the npm script to generate the Bearer token:

```bash
npm run generate:auth-header
```

Copy the output `Authorization: Bearer ...` header and use it in Postman under the `grants-ui-backend-bearer_token` in Environments tab for your requests.

⚠️ Make sure the environment variables match what the backend config expects.

### Usage

- **Send Requests**:
  Once imported, you can navigate through the requests in the collection and send them directly to the API.

- **Customize Variables**:
  If using an environment file, adjust variables like `base_url` to match your local or deployed API instance.

### Keeping the Collection Updated

The Postman collection is maintained in the repository under the `/postman/` directory. If the API changes, the collection will be updated accordingly. Pull the latest changes from the repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date collection.

### Example Folder Structure

```
